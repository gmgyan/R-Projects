Dataset summary:
=======================
<small>
As a part of data set, instead of using already available offline data, I have tried to gather live or most recent data on recend data science (DS) jobs in Ontario, Canada from www.indeed.ca. This data is then explored and analyzed in order to determine the relationship between a set of variables. In particlular, the reason for choosing this data is to try to answer the following questions as an aspiring DS professional:

```
Q1. Location wise job listings ?
Q2. What are top six companies with most jobs in data science ?
Q3. Analyst vs Scientist jobs
Q4. What is the most commonly used word in job postings ?
Q5. Most popular skillsets required for DS job ?
```
